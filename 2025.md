## Overview
{: #overview}

The **2025 Workshop on Artificial Intelligence in Earth & Planetary Sciences (AIEPS 2025)** was a full-day hybrid event hosted by the Geological Survey of Finland (GTK) and co-organized with the **SEG Distinguished Instructor Short Course (DISC)**.

The workshop explored emerging trends in **AI, machine learning, and scientific computing** as applied to Earth and planetary systems. It coincided with the visit of **Professor Mrinal K. Sen** (University of Texas Institute for Geophysics) under the **MULTIVERSE project** funded by the Research Council of Finland.

Participants from geoscience, data science, and engineering disciplines gathered to discuss how artificial intelligence is reshaping fields from **geophysics and remote sensing** to **planetary exploration** and **climate modeling**.
