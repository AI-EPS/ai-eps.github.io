**AIEPS (AI in Earth & Planetary Sciences)** is a special interest group dedicated to advancing the application of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and scientific computing in Earth and Planetary Sciences.

We bring together researchers, practitioners, and students to explore how AI is transforming geoscience research, from climate modeling and geophysical inversion to planetary exploration and natural hazard prediction.
