        <h4>Abstract</h4>
        <p>This seminar presented recent advances in applying deep learning techniques to satellite imagery for environmental monitoring applications. We explored convolutional neural network architectures optimized for multi-spectral data, transfer learning approaches for limited labeled datasets, and real-world case studies in land cover classification and change detection.</p>
        <p>Key topics included automated feature extraction from Sentinel-2 imagery, temporal analysis using LSTM networks, and challenges in scaling models across different geographic regions and sensor types.</p>
